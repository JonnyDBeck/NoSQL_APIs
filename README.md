## Description
This is a simple test for a user/thought system using Mongoose. You can use routes to interact with the server to get, create, change, and delete both Users and Thoughts.
Both the Users and Thoughts have alternate systems that can be called: Add and Delete friends and Add and Delete reactions respectively.
